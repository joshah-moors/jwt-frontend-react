Front-end app for back-end service that is protected with JWT authentication.

## Back-end service

The falcon back-end app is available in my Github: [falcon-jwt-api](https://github.com/joshah-moors/falcon-jwt-api)

During development, both services will be running on localhost at different ports.

## Start the front-end service

Run `npm start`
